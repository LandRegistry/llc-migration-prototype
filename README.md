# Local Land Charges migration prototypes
## Created September 2023

This prototype supercedes https://llc-prototypes.herokuapp.com/ and https://landreg-llc.herokuapp.com/

This prototype is used to test new features aimed at enhancing the Local Land Charge data migration services that are used by HMLR staff and Local Authorities.

## About the Prototype Kit

Go to the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit site](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs) to download the latest version and read the documentation.

The Prototype Kit provides a simple way to make interactive prototypes that look like pages on GOV.UK. These prototypes can be used to show ideas to people you work with, and to do user research.
